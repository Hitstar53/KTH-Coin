# KTH Coin
Aim to create a simple blockchain and a crypto currency on top of it using vanilla data structures like linked lists & graphs in Java  

# Setup
Run: `git clone https://github.com/Hitstar53/KTH-Coin.git`  
Run `Transact.java` for blockchain testing  
Run: `LoginFrame.java` for GUI testing  

# About
The KTH blockchain has addition and deletion of blocks on buy/sell commands. It also has the secure SHA-256 Algorithm applied as the hashing algorithm for its blocks  
All transactions are stored in a sperate class object with relevant information about the sender & the reciever  
The trade of the crypto currency is stimulated using a GUI made entirely in Java Swing
